                    - I Wanna Meet Bob Dylan                
                I wanna meet bob dylan
I always thought my life would be a hell of a ride
but I feel I've spent most of it sitting on a passenger side
I've been hiding in the dark just watching a play
and then the lights gonna turn back on and I'm old and gray
old and gray
old and gray
so old and gray in the blink of an eye I'll be
old and gray
I've gotta feeling that its gonna be a brand new start
you've seen my face many times before now I should show you my heart
don't wanna see all childhood colors fade away
soon the lights gonna turn back on and I'm old and gray
old and gray
old and gray
so old and gray in the blink of an eye I'll be
old and gray
(i wanna meet bob dylan)
seems like i'm gonna make it after all            "
