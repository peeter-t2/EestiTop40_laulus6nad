                    - Astronaut                
                When I was a child - always dreamed about 
jumpin' on the moon, bein' an astronaut 
now I'm doin' it - not enjoyin' it 
I'd like to be home with my friends 
alla these monitors - all the stars around 
all this emptyness I am losin' my mind 
how the hell did they just leave me here 
I'm one of these chosen ones 
who are flyin' around in their 
cold metal-bird 
I'm an astronaut 
I'm lfyin' around 
I've been always here, there's nobody 
bringing me home 
Oh I miss my mom & I miss my dog 
bad dreams come to me it's part of my life 
I am losin' it, crazy anyway 
turbulence's shakin' my brains            "
