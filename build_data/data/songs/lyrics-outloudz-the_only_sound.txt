                    - The Only Sound                
                When the war is over,
all the flames have turned to dust.
We can finally go home.
I've been dreaming of it happening for long.
Yes, I've been dreaming of us going back home.
When the war is over,
every reason's been forgot. 
Why it actually started?
We don't remember whatever was the goal,
we don't remember when did we lose our souls. 
When the lights go out while you sleep,
you'll never know what it's like to be free.
Imagine laying numb on the ground
and the silence is the only sound,
the only sound. 
When the war is over
we will wonder whatever was the goal,
we will wonder when did we lose our souls.
For when the lights go out while you sleep
you'll never know what it's like to be free.
When the stakes are high as high can be
you forget what it all's supposed to mean.
Run away with me,  
run away with me. 
We can still be free,
we can still be free. 
Imagine laying numb on the ground 
and the silence is the only sound, 
the only sound.            "
