                    - Please Don't Cry                
                 Feels like you're all alone
Got no place to call your home
Waiting for that someone
to get away the pain
Promises given
are meant to be broken
the ones you believed in
Destroyed your faith and trust
CHORUS
Just don't cry
I am here by your side
there's no place you can hide
get ride of that feeling
Please don't cry
Sometimes things can go wrong
But you have to be strong
the sorrow won't last for long
Hold onto someone
who understands your sorrow
you've got no reasons
to believe you're on your own
CHORUS
Once in a while you stumble and fall
but then you have to try to carry on
CHORUS"
