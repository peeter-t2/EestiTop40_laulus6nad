                    - The Lucky Ones                
                We are the lucky ones!
Oh whatever comes
We are the lucky ones!
Ooooh Yeah!
We are the lucky ones!
Oh whatever comes
We are the lucky ones!
Ooh ooh hoo (3x)
We are (3x)
Ooh ooh hoo (3x)
We are (3x)
Ooh ooh hoo (3x)
We are (3x)
Ooh ooh hoo (3x)
We are (3x)
And when your world
Is crumbling down
I can make it better.
When you're lost,
need to be found
I will look for e-ever.
For you (3x)
We are the lucky ...
And when your world
Is crumbling down
I can make it better.
When you're lost,
need to be found
I will look for-e-ever.
Just keep me close,
there is no storm
That we cannot weather.
However high, however low
I will face for-e-ever
For you (4x)
We are the lucky ...
Ooh ooh hoo (3x) ...
We are the lucky ones!            "
