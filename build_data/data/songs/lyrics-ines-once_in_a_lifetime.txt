                    - Once In A Lifetime                
                I don't wish, I could turn back time.
I can move the mountains higher than high.
Don't look back, hold on your spirit.
Keep moving every minute.
I know it seems a little premature.
To live for the moment, I'm just a girl.
Don't look back, hold on your spirit.
Keep moving every minute.
What you give is what you get.
There ain't no regrets.
If you give me wings and reason why.
Then I'll be an angel in your sky.
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime.
Read my mind.
I'm ready why you standing still.
Are you coming with me, I know you will.
We can search the world together.
Come on baby now or never.
What you give is what you get.
There ain't no regrets.
If you give me wings and reason why.
Then I'll be an angel in your sky.
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime.
Read my mind.
If you give me wings and reason why.
Then I'll be an angel in your sky.
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime.
Read my mind.
I believe there's a better place always somewhere else instead.
I believe grass is greener if i chase the magic no one else can find.
( The magic no one else can find ) .
If you give me wings and reason why.
Then I'll be an angel in your sky.
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime.
Read my mind.
If you give me wings and reason why.
Then I'll be an angel in your sky.
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime.
Read my mind.
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime.            "
