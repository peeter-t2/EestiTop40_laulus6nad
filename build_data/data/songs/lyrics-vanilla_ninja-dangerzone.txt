                    - Dangerzone                
                Lock me up in chains
Want to be with me
Think you know the score
Feel my burning flames
Wanna hold me tight
Wanna be adored
Feel my curse
Welcome to the dangerzone
Feel the poison in my veins
Tell me are you strong enough
To keep up with my life
Welcome to the dangerzone
What you see ain't what you get
Let us fly this aeroplane
Tonight
Did you see the sign
Did you read the warning in my eyes
Got a heavy load
Gotta stay on track when things explode
And together we'll go through the fire
Will you stay by my side?
Welcome to the dangerzone
Feel the poison in my veins
Tell me are you strong enough
To keep up with my life
Welcome to the dangerzone
What you see ain't what you get
Let us fly this aeroplane
Tonight
Come with me
Feel the need
YouÂ’re mine tonight
I will win this fight
Come with me
Hold the key
Of destiny
Welcome to the dangerzone
Feel the poison in my veins
Tell me are you strong enough
To keep up with my life
Welcome to the danger zone
What you see ain't what you get
Let us fly this aeroplane
Tonight            "
