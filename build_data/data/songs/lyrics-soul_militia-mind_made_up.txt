                    - mind made up                
                One friday night I was
Out with my fellas
That's when I saw you
Drinkin' your cocktail
Lookin' right at me
That's when I knew
That you will come to me
You wanna talk to me 
And try to work things out
But you keep forgetting 
You were not true to me
The thought of it 
Just makes me shout
Refrään
Just face the fact 
We can no longer be
Toghether you and me
I want your little games 
With me to stop
I've got my mind made up
You need to understand 
The pain you put me through
Wont take it no more
When I was by the phone 
Waiting for you to call
You were so sure
That I had no doubt
I wouldn't find out
What you've been doing late at night
Would have forgiven once
But making the same mistake
Won't definetely make things right
Refrään

I loved you endlessly 
You were my world
It's just so hard for me 
Why'd you do this to me girl?
Räp
Girl where's your brain
Everything we had is down the drain
Think you know the pain?
You know s..t so quit the games
You've got s..t to gain
You played me and it's a shame
Must have been
The last time I'd trust again
Just a man hurt by lust again
My heart's crushed again
'Cause you cheated on me
Won't be no us again
So why you back, huh?
You backstabber
Now you wanna talk and you cry
What's the matter?
Standin' here tryin' to make it better
You be talkin' more s..t than my grandma
The world ain't no damn swingers club
You got issues 
Please don't bring em up
Go getcha cocktail drink it up
And gimme that ring 
Before I break ya ringfinger off
Sild
Refrään"
