                Life was unkind until the day I met you 
Was completely out of hand
Whats on my mind whats eatin me really dont know
Catch me honey dont let go
There was something in you
You just came helped me grow
Why I punish myself by letting you go 
Theres no way out
Youre hard to resist oh why
There is no doubt
I can be the only
I wonder how to wipe all your tears away
Look at me now
Im just going crazy
This very day Im willing to change my mind
I have nothing left at all
Ive realized that you are the one of the kind
I cant just erase my memories
You give me hope
Baby lets take it slow
Every moment changes my point of view
Theres no way out
Dont go too fast maybe wont last forever
Hold on the past but its always getting better
I have never waited so long this must really feel strong
Im just going crazy
Theres no way out"
