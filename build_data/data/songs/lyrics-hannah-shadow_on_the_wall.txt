                    - Shadow On The Wall                
                VERSE
Rush hour a soft summer rain
Some things never change
When I’m home the lights are on but nobody’s there
I guess it’s gonna take some time
To realize that you’re not mine anymore
A late night and I’m stuck in a moment
Still waiting for your call
It’s been like this for weeks and nothing‘s changed
I guess I‘ve tried some things
But then they haven’t worked at all
My life needs to rearrange
CHORUS
And it was you who used to turn me on
You got me all (all)
And thanks to you my life is upside down
I feel like a shadow on the wall
And it was you who used to turn me on
You gave me all all
And it was you who used to hold my soul
Now I’m like shadow on the wall        
VERSE
Sometimes when the sun comes down
I just take my car and leave the town
I run away from you and from myself
I wish I‘d leave it all behind
And celebrate a brand new life
With you no longer there
CHORUS
And it was you who used to turn me on
You got me all all
And thanks to you my life is upside down
I feel like a shadow on the wall
And it was you who used to turn me on
You gave me all all
And it was you who used to hold my soul
Now I’m like shadow on the wall            "
