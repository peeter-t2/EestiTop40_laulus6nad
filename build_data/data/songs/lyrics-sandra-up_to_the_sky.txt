                    - Up To The Sky                
                The people of the city I'm talking about,
there's a big gold valley in a big blue sky.
And you can ever ever go there, before you die.
But I wanna be there, I wanna live there,
I wanna hear the sounds of the sea,
the who knows, who told that I cannot go there.
That I would never ever ever gonna be there,
the life is a surprise, so you can't never what...
So you better look out, or wouldn't you never find out
but I don't know how and I don't know why,
so you got to figure it out, before so while
to be surprised, 'cause I'm the one who's gonna try,
to get up to the sky, to the paradise.
I gonna walk the stairs and say your prayer,
I don't know even are they gonna accept me there?
Step by step I got to go,
I got to go up to the sky,
where is the paradise,
that's so hard to find.
I got to get there.
The way you understand,
it seems like the land is for the good man.
You know what I mean,
like you can't lie and you can't make you cry.
And now I got to try, cuz it seems to worth
the wise? i gotta prove and move to the groovie
that's the way to do.
Cuz everybody knows that you can't get anywhere,
when you do everything, just like you do anything.
You take a close look, what it looks like,
all you can know that it is a sunlight,
that shine down on you, that's why.
Step by step I got to go,
I got to go up to the sky,
where is the paradise,
that's so hard to find.
Step by step I got to go,
I got to go up to the sky,
where is the paradise,
that's so hard to find.            "
