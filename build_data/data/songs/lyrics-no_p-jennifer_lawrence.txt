                    - Jennifer Lawrence                
                We had known only for a few hours,
when we were standing in the line for the showers
you told me: \"Come away with me to an island.\"
I said I'll think about it, I said I'll think about it.
And you owned me for real in the loudness
as we were screaming at 5am in the morning.
You told me: \"Come away with me don't fight it.\"
I said I´ll think about it, I said I'll think about it.
I said I'll think about it, I said I'll think about it.
And I know that I'm slow, but it never got me so deep before, and I.
And I know that it was short, but I've never gotten so keen before, and I.
And I.
And your name is all that I had when I got home,
but I did not remember your real name only the false.
You told me that you're Jennifer Lawrence who am I,
I said I'll think aobut it, I said I'll think about it.
I said I'll think aobut it, I said I'll think about it.
And I know that I'm slow, but it never got me so deep before, and I.
And I know that it was short, but I've never gotten so keen before, and I.
And I know that I'm slow, but it never got me so deep before, and I.
And I know that it was short, but I've never gotten so keen before, and I.
Don't really matter no more you've got another man's ring now
(another man's ring now)
(another man's ring now)
And I know that I'm slow, but it never never
And I know that I'm slow, but it never got me so deep before, and I.
And I know that it was short, but I've never gotten so keen before.
And I know that I'm slow, but it never got me so deep before, and I.
And I know that it was short, but I've never gotten so keen before.            "
