                I was no one special
just another face in the crowd.
Until i met you
I don't think i knew what life as about
You gave me hope 
You made me feel like
And i never want that to end
But most of all
You touched me deep inside
You're so much more than friend
Anywhere you go
you know that I would follow
Baby you're my shining star
Yeah you know that
Anywhere you go
you'll never be alone
Cause I will be right where you are
Shining star (4x)
I remember how it was
before you showed me the light
I couldn't find my way
and nothing I was doing was right
You made me hope 
when I was incomplete
And i never want that to end
You saved my life
You gave me all I need
You're so much more than friend
Anywhere you go
you know that I would follow
Baby you're my shining star
Yeah you know that
Anywhere you go
you'll never be alone
Cause I will be right where you are
Shining star (4x)
Where would I be
If fate had never brought you to me
Oh what would I do?
I'd probably still be waiting for
Anywhere you go
you know that I would follow
Baby you're my shining star
Yeah you know that
Anywhere you go
you'll never be alone
Cause I will be right where you are (3x)
Shining star            "
