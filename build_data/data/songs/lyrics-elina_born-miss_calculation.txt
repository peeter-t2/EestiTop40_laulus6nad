                    - Miss Calculation                
                so I step into spotlight
I ain´t gonna shine for one night
don´t wanna see a red light 
as I go along
I used to get a fever
but now I´m so much stronger
still all my mixed emotions
get blown out of proportions
I do not even hurry
althought I sometimes worry
my bad miscalculation
could spoil this operation
why don+ t you let me combine
your icy stare with sunshine
eventually you´ll be mine
so don´t be shy
am I miss Calculation
or Miss Miscalculation
that you will never know
keep moving with the flow
my only destination 
is each and every station
so let me pave the way
it´s gonna be ok
come on and be my lover
all winter spring and summer
we´ll keep it undercover
all the way
don´t be undecided
there´s no need to hide it
once you´ve gone and tried it
there´s no way back
so do not feel ashamed
it´s only just a game
that you and I can play
anyday
no in it for the money
so would you be my bunny
so many pots of honey
make us feel alright
am I miss Calculation
or Miss Miscalculation
that you will never know
keep moving with the flow
my only destination 
is each and every station
so let me pave the way
it´s gonna be ok
am I miss Calculation
or Miss Miscalculation
that you will never know
keep moving with the flow
my only destination 
is each and every station
so let me pave the way
it´s gonna be ok
am I miss Calculation
or Miss Miscalculation
that you will never know
keep moving with the flow
my only destination 
is each and every station
so let me pave the way
it´s gonna be ok            "
