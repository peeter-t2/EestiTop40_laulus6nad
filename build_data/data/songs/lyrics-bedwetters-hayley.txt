                Falling down on you
Just to have some
Just to have some fun
I´m Falling down on you
Falling down on you
Cos´ you got some
Cos´ you got some hun
I´m Falling down on you
You got it all- the looks, the talk
 I mean the way you walk is insane
You got it all- the moves, the grace 
I mean the way you taste is sweet
Im tellin you it´s gonna be crazy
this night I mean is gonna get hazy
feeling high from toes to hair
out of my mind i´m feeling your glare
Im tellin you it´s gonna be crazy
this night I mean is gonna get hazy
feeling high from toes to hair
And out of my mind i´m feelin´ you
Falling down on me
I can taste you
I can feel u girl
having fun with me
Falling down on me
I can feel you
I can taste your lips
Pressing down on me
You got it all- the looks, the talk
 I mean the way you walk is insane
You got it all- the moves, the grace 
I mean the way you taste is sweet
Im tellin you it´s gonna be crazy
this night I mean is gonna get hazy
feeling high from toes to hair
out of my mind i´m feeling your glare
Im tellin you it´s gonna be crazy
this night I mean is gonna get hazy
feeling high from toes to hair
And out of my mind i´m feelin´ you            "
