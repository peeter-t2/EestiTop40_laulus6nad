                She likes when I am a rudeboy 8x
oh yes
i have her money
don't worry I will pay
hey under her umbrella
I'd even say her name
She likes when I am a rudeboy
I do whatever she says
every night in my dreams
I make love to you
oh yes
I have her money
don't worry will pay
hey under her umbrella
I'd even say her name
She likes when I am a rudeboy
I do whatever she says
every night in my dreams
make love to RIHANNA
What now we found love
won't diamonds make you stay?
oh please don't stop the music
pour it up
where have you been?
don't love the way you lie
you are my only girl
you are the one
who's been unfaithful
I hate that I love you
this ain't no love song
you've shot your man down
oh yes I have her money
don't worry I will pay
hey under her umbrella
I'd even say her name
she likes when I am a rudeboy
I do whatever she says
every night in my dreams
I make love to you
oh yes I have her money
don't worry I will pay
hey under her umbrella
I'd even say her name
she likes when I am a rudeboy
I do whatever she says
every night in my dreams
I make love to            "
