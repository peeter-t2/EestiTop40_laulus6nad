                    Blind
                    - Emmanuelle                
                All of my life, young life
I dreamed about the same things that my dad did over the years
Well she's a girl, nice girl
So nice you have to wonder if she really exists
Well it's so sad, so sad
That I am here and she is over there in this fictional land
You wonder where, right there in my daddy's dirty magazines
And on my tape, that's where she stands
Sometimes I set myself free
Let my mind play
And then there she is
My Emmanuelle on my VCR
There you are
It's time to be with me
My little sweet, sweet Emmanuelle
I see her lying there in waterbed
With (?), my Emmanuelle
And that's the way it's gotta be
I'm with this girl from real world
We do all the things that couples do
We're having a blast 
And when it's time, bedtime 
I turn on my TV-set 
Then I crawl to bed really fast
Sometimes I set myself free
Let my mind play
And then there she is
My Emmanuelle on my VCR
There you are
It's time to be with me
My little sweet, sweet Emmanuelle
I see her lying there in waterbed
With (?), my Emmanuelle
And that's the way it's gotta be
I set myself free
Let my mind play
And then there she is
My Emmanuelle 
I see her lying there in waterbed
With (?), my Emmanuelle
And that's the way it's gotta be            "
