                1.
It´s okay, it´s alright!
You know i´m close by.
Little dark, little high,
Do you see?
---
Was it you? Was it me?
Was it too much time?
Come erase and rewind
Yeah please...!
REF.
Wake me up and let me in,
love me till the morning!
God is good, it´s not a sin...
It´s only yours and mine!
2.
When we meet, in the park,
it feels so good and new...
Break it down, light the spark
again!
---
You´re alone, maybe true,
I just had to try it out...
Should i go, should i play
With rain...?
REF.
Wake me up and let me in,
love me till the morning!
God is good, it´s not a sin...
It´s only yours and mine!            "
