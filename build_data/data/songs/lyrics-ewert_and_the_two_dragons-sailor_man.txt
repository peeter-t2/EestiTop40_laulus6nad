                    - Sailor man                
                If I was a sailor man
With you i'd sail and search for land
No panic, boundaries, no fear
Hands focused on the wheel i'd steer
Heart beating in a race
No storm would take us down
Inspired by the place
I'd never﻿ let you drown
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this love
If I was a sailor man
With you i'd sail and search for land
No panic, boundaries, no fear
Hands focused on the wheel i'd steer
Heart beating in a race
(Sailor man..)
No storm would take us down
(Sailor man..)
Inspired by the place
(Sailor man..)
I'd never﻿ let you drown
(Sailor man..)
Heart beating in a race
(Sailor man..)
No storm would take us down
(Sailor man..)
Inspired by the place
(Sailor man..)
I'd never﻿ let you drown
(Sailor man..)
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this love
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this love
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this love
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this love
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this ..
(I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this ...)
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this ...
(I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this ...)
Heart beating in a race
No storm would take us down
Inspired by the place
I'd never﻿ let you drown
Heart beating in a race
(Sailor man..)
No storm would take us down
(Sailor man..)
Inspired by the place
(Sailor man..)
I'd never﻿ let you drown
(Sailor man..)
Heart beating in a race
(Sailor man..)
No storm would take us down
(Sailor man..)
Inspired by the place
(Sailor man..)
I'd never﻿ let you drown
(Sailor man..)
I wouldn't wanna spend a day
Without this love            "
