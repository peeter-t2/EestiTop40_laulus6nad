                    - Days of our Lives                
                I look at the lights and it starts to rain
I see such a weeks that anger and pain
What would I do should it be
This life in cloris is not for me
It`s another lonely day of my life
Once again i`ve lost my endless ride
It` starting from things that fell in
It`s starting with my words within in
You can`t stop us now
You can`t hold us down
You can`t stop us now
Now just belive me
Around us, all this mess around us
I don`t really care less, so im really agree
Around us, all this mess around us
I don`t really care less, you can`t bury me
Like many others i got confused
Like all the others i`ve been misused
When the crowds are gone and noone see
that this land is not for me
It`s another lonely day of my life
Once again i`ve lost my endless ride
It` starting from things that fell in
It`s starting with my words within in
You can`t stop us now
You can`t hold us down
You can`t stop us now
Now just belive me
Around us, all this mess around us
I don`t really care less, so im really agree
Around us, all this mess around us
I don`t really care less, you can`t bury me
Around us, all this mess around us
I don`t really care less, so im really agree
Around us, all this mess around us
I don`t really care less, you can`t bury me             "
