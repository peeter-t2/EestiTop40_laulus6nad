                    - 365 days                
                you promised to be around
clear as day
you (are) probably changing your ways
i'm waiting here all alone
all the way
for 365 days
don't wanna fight
but you promised you'll be by my side
lonely days and just confusion
on the other side of night
words - these only words you say
such delay
for 365 days
don't wanna fight
but you promised you'll be by my side
lonely days and just confusion
on the other side of night
don't wanna fight
but you promised you'll be by my side
is it right or is (it) insane
why i stay awake and wait
still feels (like) you're the air that i need
the rhythm of every beat
lets make the ends finally meet
this (is) breaking apart our hearts
don't wanna fight
but you promised you'll be by my side
lonely days and just confusion
on the other side of night
don't wanna fight
but you promised you'll be by my side
is it right or is (it) insane
why i stay awake and wait"
