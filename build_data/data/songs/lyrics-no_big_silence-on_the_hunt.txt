                    No Big Silence
                    - On The Hunt                
                One by one we move the ground
Everyone's turned into a hound
Cuz hey everyone has to pay
One by one we make the stakes
Everyone's been greedy too afraid to fate
And why when the target is sky
Hey innocent angel
Innocent angel
Innocent angel
Innocent angel
We're on the hunt 
You might run but we're right behind
You might fly but not too high
We'd rather die then let you to hide
You are so precious we know your price 
Be afraid of us we are cold as ice
That's why you should stay in the sky
Hey innocent angel
Innocent angel
Innocent angel
Innocent angel
We're on the hunt 
You are so precious we know your price
Be afraid of us we are cold as ice
It's allright we will get you tonight
Hey innocent angel 
Innocent angel
Innocent angel
Innocent angel
We're on the hunt 
Hey innocent angel
I don't regret my sins
Hey innocent angel
I'm gonna cut your wings "
