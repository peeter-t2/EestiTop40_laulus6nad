                    Vanilla Ninja
                    - Liar                
                We found a place to be
So far from despondency
But you found a thousand ways
To shadow up my face
Your kisses turned from hot to cold
And I felt - like a centerfold
Cheap 'n' nasty - with dirty men
Lookin' for love that they never will get
Sitting in the dark just feeling low
I'm ruined to the heart - I'm on the road
To nowhere - to nowhere
If you wanna lie to me again
There is a rotten place they call the end
Just go there - and stay there
Liar
oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh
Liar
oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh
You took a quick escape
But left your lies in perfect shape
As long as my mem'ries live
I never will - forgive you
So if we meet - somewhere tonight
You'd better - be set to fight
In the darkness - of missing stars
You won't see me
But you'll feel me inside
[Chorus]
The winds of change - blow through my soul
And the warlords try to take control
I will never rely on you
And the pain will hit you sham on you
[Chorus]            "
