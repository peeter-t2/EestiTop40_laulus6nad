                    Super Slinky
                    - I JUST LOVE IT                
                Tell me what's a beauty like you doin' here
Sittin' in this gloomy room and just idlin' away the day
Allow me to take you to a little cosy place downtown
Where they play real freaky music, where we can have a good time
You know I hate to see you gettin' blue
You know that it's a waste of the potential within you
I'd love to see you movin' in a slinky dress
I got to see you dancin', to see your sexy dance
Let your attractive body move
To spread your sweet perfume, it makes me feel so good
Let your fair-complexioned legs flash from under the dress
I'd love to see you ripple when you dance
Baby let me take you out to have a wonderful time
Baby let me see you dancin', oh please, tonight
It is your duty to let that beauty shine
Yeah tonight we're gonna feel fine
I just love it
When you're in the groove
Cos it makes your
Sexy body move
Baby come along now
You're gonna be
My true star tonight
So don't you love it too?
That cosy place is not so far
Gimme the keys, gimme the keys we can take the car
But I let you drive yeah you know why
Simply cos it looks so fine
Don't you see that you just need
To set your feelings free
We'll do some fancy dancin', gimme one of your hands and
I'll take you there, I see you have no better plans, yeah
Baby let me see your legs flash from under the dress
Let me see your breasts ripple when you dance
It is your duty to let that beauty shine
Yeah tonight we're gonna feel fine
I just love it
When you're in the groove
Cos it makes your
Sexy body move
Baby come along now
You're gonna be
My true star tonight
So don't you love it too?
Baby let me take you out to have a wonderful time
Baby let me see you dancin', oh please, tonight
It is your duty to let that beauty shine
Yeah tonight we're gonna feel fine
I just love it
When you're in the groove
Cos it makes your
Sexy body move
Baby come along now
You're gonna be
My true star tonight
So don't you love it too?
