                    - Long. Some Distance                
                You just can't tell
when you're longing for more
You just can't tell
when you're hooked up for sure
Imagine, time getting slower by the second
minutes turn into hours, they really do
so fragile, like a flower in the wind
you might break, its too much to take for you
You just can't tell
when you're longing for more
You just can't tell
when you're hooked up for sure
Imagine, wind touching you like an angel
when you stand alone, so on your own
So fragile, like a snowflake in the sky
you might melt, when you touch the ground.
You just can't tell
when you're longing for more
You just can't tell
when you're hooked up for sure.            "
