                    Mr. Lawrence
                    - Annabel                
                Sometimes I feel like I'm ready for a crime
the picture's getting clear
I'm running out of time
Well I need Your love
I'm born to fly
so won't You help me touch the sky
Annabel, Annabel
I'll meet You at the Wishing Well
Annabel, Annabel
So many things I have to tell
Annabel, Annabel
I'll meet You at the Wishing Well
I hope You ring a bell
Through the Gates of Heaven
hand in hand we walk
Using bigger words
we dream of smaller talk
I need Your love
I'm born to fly
so won't You help me touch the sky
I know the truth again
I've seen the light again            "
