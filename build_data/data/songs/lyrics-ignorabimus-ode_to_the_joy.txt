Piece Of Water Falls On Me
It's A Tear Coming From My Heart
Frightening Is This Thought:
What If It's A Tragedy?
The Colours Of Rainbow
Don't Loose The Pain
Also Memories Sweet
Are Unable To Cover The Sad
The Tear Grows In Time
To Become A Sea Into Our Sadness Drowns
There Will Be The Time
All The Pain And Dissapointment
Also Mourning And Evils Lust
I See In This Tear
It's In Me But Who Cares
Once There Will Be A Sea Into We Drown
Into Our Sadness Drowns
I Am Off The Ground Tonight
You Are On My Mind
I Don't Remember When I Did
Get Orgasm Tasting Ice-Cream....
Soft And Sweet Melodies 
From Other Side Of Life That Doesn't Excist
So I Don't I, So Doesn't The Tear
Only The Tear ...
Resting In Your Warmth And
Enjoy'n This Luxury
Frightening Is This Thought:
What If It's A Tragedy?"
