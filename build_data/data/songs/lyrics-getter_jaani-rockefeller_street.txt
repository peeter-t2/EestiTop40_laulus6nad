                    - Rockefeller Street                
                daylight is fading away
night silhouettes in the sky
LED lights are flashing on towers
it`s manhattan`s magical time
ballerinas dancing the \"Swan Lake\"
on a river made of diamonds and pearls
everything is a little bit weird now
because tonight  
it is showtime
in the middle of the street life
all we celebrite a good times  
because tonight it is showtime
come and walk with me
1273 down the Rockefeller street
life is marchin on do you feel that
1273 down the Rockefeller street
Everything is more than surreal   
Oldschool Hollywood stars
Party cinderellas are here
The move like computer game heroes
Because they know
it is showtime
in the middle of the street life
all they celebrite a good times  
because tonight it is showtime
so let`s keep movin on
C:………
keep movin , keep movin , keep movin , keep movin
if you want to know what  Rockefeller groove is
keep movin , keep movin , keep movin , keep movin
time is right to celebrite a good times            "
