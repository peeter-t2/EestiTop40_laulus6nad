                Keep me waitin' for your call

don't you want me anymore, baby

cause i'm taking my chances
does it love you, that's for sure
It's devine when you were mine
i don't wanna lose the magic in your eyes
(so) if you mine, come on say it,say it
Chorus:
Say you will, say you wanna be there for me
i can wait forever, tell me that we're together
say you will, say you wanna be there always
love me now or never, come on say it,say it
say you will
I think you mean that friends you say

Don't you know, my dreams are built upon
understanding and divotion
