                    - Say It                
                If youre down with the groove
Just say yeah
Like the way that I move
You should just say yeah
Wanna get dirty
Hungry for a party
Like a v.i.p.
You could just say yeah
If you like my perfume
Just say yeah
Think that we should get a room
You could just say yeah
Give me a sign
Your place or mine
You wanna spend the night
You should just say yeah
Im tired of being told
The same shit all along
Better save my time
And just make up your mind
Nows the time to choose
The plan were gonna use
Throw your fears away
Girl you dont have to
Play with me all night long
You dont have to
Stay with me all night long
You just have to
Move while the heat is on
You dont have to
Worry bout the money
Keep your motor runnin
Show me the way you move
You just have to
Tell me what youre into
You just have to
Say what you wanna do
You just have to
Say it say it
If you dont wanna play
Just say no
If you wanna get paid
You should just say no
If you only teasin
And you aint easy
Downright sleazy
You could just say no
If youre not in the mood
Just say no
If youre happy with your dude
You could just say no
If you think youre in love with me
Think Ill be your baby daddy
Not me- better just say no
Im tired of being told
The same shit all along
Better save my time
And just make up your mind
Nows the time to choose
The plan were gonna use
Throw your fears away
Girl you dont have to
Play with me all night long
You dont have to
Stay with me all night long
You just have to
Move while the heat is on
You dont have to
Worry bout the money
Keep your motor runnin
Show me the way you move
You just have to
Tell me what youre into
You just have to
Say what you wanna do
You just have to
Say it say it
Say if you wanna get down tonight
Say if youre gonna stay here tonight
Say if you gotta go home tonight
Say you will say you wont
Say if you wanna get down tonight
Say if youre gonna stay here tonight
Say if you gotta go home tonight
Say it just say it
Play with me all night long
You dont have to
Stay with me all night long
You just have to
Move while the heat is on
You dont have to
Worry bout the money
Keep your motor runnin
Show me the way you move
You just have to
Tell me what youre into
You just have to
Say what you wanna do
You just have to
Say it say it"
