                    - Never Be Same                
                There was something wrong
With you and me
And life we lived before that day
You just came into my life
When I was week 
Needed someone to stay
Now my life never be same
There is no one to blame
My life never be same
Never be same
After while we understood
That nothing ever canâ€™t destroy our life
That our feelings were too strong
And only thing we needed 
Was little time
Now my life never be same
There is no one to blame
My life never be same
Never be same            "
