                    - Melyse                
                If you believe in dreams
And the trance-like state
That will come around
When you’re not awake
Then once in the sea of thoughts
I saw raging sharks
Biting bits into my camouflage
Hey!
The lights are breaking
I see all the worlds go past
I never stop!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page, and let it go!
O-Oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
Melyse are you still awake?
Melyse are you still okay?
They told me to turn away
From a dead way
Making my teeth fall out
In the strangest way
I was the calmest one
In the dream that day
With no teeth I had nothing to say
Headlights are breaking
I see all the worlds go past
I never stop!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
So when I woke
I played a game
With all the promises you made
But I don`t see you in my dreams no more
No more
No, I don`t see you in my dreams no more
Hey the lights…
Melyse you`re not awake!
They are….
Melyse you’re not okay!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
Melyse you’re not awake
Melyse you’re not okay            "
