                    - Cool Vibes                
                Don't want you to lead me to the dark
Don't need you to tear my heart apart
Don't do that, though people say that you're my enemy
I know you can set me free 
Don't want you to come so close to me
Don't need you to blow my fantasy
But I know that you are livin' far beyond those lies
I can see the danger rise in your eyes 
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
Cool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray 
Cool vibes, why don't you thrill me
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny 
Don't want you to make me feel afraid
Don't need you to take away the hate
But I know that you will break the seal of mystery
Leave it to my fantasy, what will be 
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
Cool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray 
Cool vibes, why don't you thrill me
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny 
Stay close to me, infinity
Enigma's what we share
But I don't care
You'll be there 
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
Cool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray
(For some broken heroes) 
Cool vibes, why don't you thrill me
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny "
