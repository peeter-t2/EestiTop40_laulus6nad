                    - AMAZING                
                \"amazing\"
Remember how we used to be
 Floating the skies, it felt so heavenly
 We were weightless
 We froze to ice and melted down
 We chased the stars and felt to the ground
 Couldn't care less
 This feeling inside
 You're all that I have, I need you back
 Do you hear me screaming?
2x REF:
Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)
 I don't, don't want another to make me high
 I want, want you to be amazing lie
 Stay amazing lie 
 You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
 I'd brake the curse of time to be with you
 I'd be fearless
 I'd jump as far as I can see
 And beat the perfect storm in the endless sea
 This feeling inside
 You're all that I have, I need you back
 Do you hear me screaming?
REF:
Stay amazing lie....
 This feeling inside
 You're all that I have, I need you back
 We were weightless
REF:
Stay amazing lie.....            "
