                    - Walking on air                
                There's a little creepy house
In a little creepy place
Little creepy town
In a little creepy world
Little creepy girl
With her little creepy face
Saying funny things that u have never heard
Do you know what it's all about
How you're braving not to figure out 
Know that you could set the world on fire
Feeling strong enough to leave for doubts
[Chorus:]
Feel it, breathe it, believe it
and you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly, so high
and you'll be walking on air
Feel it, unless you kill it
go on and you'll forgive him
I knew that I could feel that
I feel like I am walking on air
She has a little creepy cat
And a little creepy bat
Little rocking chair and an old blue hat
That little creepy girl
Oh she loves to sing
She has a little gift
An amazing thing
With her little funny eyes of hazel
With her little funny old blue hat
She will go and set the world on fire
No one ever thought she could do that
[Chorus:]
Feel it, breathe it, believe it
and you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly, so high
and you'll be walking on air
Feel it, unless you kill it
go on and you'll forgive him
I knew that I could feel that
I feel like I am walking on air
Let her up and
Up her down me
All around me
All around me
You know that I love you go on
[Chorus:]
Feel it, breathe it, believe it
and you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly, so high
and you'll be walking on air
Feel it, unless you kill it
go on and you'll forgive him
I knew that I could feel that
I feel like I am walking on air
I am walking on air
I am walking on air            "
