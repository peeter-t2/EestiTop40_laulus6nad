                    - So long nanny                
                Steps on the floor, show time for the door
to scream from the hinge, to sing from the soul. 
Dust on the clock, clams on not to shock me 
with minutes left, till iÂ´ll be whole.
Im not afraid, that time flies by, 
Im not afraid to hold my head up high 
i found myself brought to books
trough the times of troubled youth. 
I found questions with no truth,
questions with no answers 
I have been weak, my mind starts to seek
a way out of my abused body.
fear starts to reak, as i rise from my seat
to grow into the life cos I am ready
Im not afraid, that time flies by, 
Im not afraid to hold my head up high 
i found myself brought to books
trough the times of troubled youth. 
I found questions with no truth,
questions with no answers 
why! Should! I give up my cradle 
time! , flies! Can I do it later ? 
why! Should! I give up my cradle 
time! , flies! Can I do it later ? 
Ill be gone for tomorrow, at least as a child I once were. as child you once knew
is there a chance I could borrow. At least as a child I once were, as a child you once knew "
