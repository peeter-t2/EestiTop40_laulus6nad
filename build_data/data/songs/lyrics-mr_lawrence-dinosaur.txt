                    Mr. Lawrence
                    - Dinosaur                
                I've been a mess I've been a fool
a fool for doing things I do
a fool who pulls a trick or two
what a disaster what a shame
what a shame you don't know my name
names are for tombstones anyway
hell I'm green
and I don't know too much of anything
both rags and crowns I've seen
never a preacher in a boxing ring
dinosaur dinosaur
hey aren't you in us all
dinosaur dinosaur
the symbol of rise and fall
there have been times of fake caress
times when I could not care less
times I said no when it should've been yes
it takes a pair of golden hands
to change the luck of a boogeyman
the kind of man I think I am
I can't explain these twists
with nothing else but pain
caused by cheap paperbacks
and gallons of champagne
I've got the creeps I'm gonna
jump right out of my head
am I losing my mind            "
