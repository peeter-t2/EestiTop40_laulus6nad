                You can’t stop me i’m a rolling stone
Coming through with every inch of my soul
To brake the silence in disguise
It’s too easy to see through your wicked lies
Soon i will make it happen
You will see me rule
The ship of sounds in the sea of rapture
Eyes pealed I will break the tide
With God as my witness I will vandalize
Nobody knows, so think it through
How does it feel, is it really you
Soon I will make it happen
You will see me rule
The ship of sounds in the sea of rapture
i’ve got nothing to loose, I will make it happen
You will see me rule
The ship of sounds in the sea of rapture
Like a thunder
Like a storm and heavy rain
Sent from God, a pure wonder
I have seen and I’m not the same
Soon I will make it happen
You will see me rule
The ship of sounds in the sea of Rapture
i’ve got nothing to loose, I will make it happen
You will see me rule
The ship of sounds in the sea of rapture            "
