                    - LITTLE SECRET                
                Sitting on the seaside
All night long with my love
Touching silence all around
She was bred for turkey cocks
Which I'm really not
They would call our love a big letdown
But we do not care
Cause they are there we are here
We know what it is we feel
And that information
We will keep to ourselves
No need for formalities
We're alone, me & my darling
Hey, we're way too far away
Her dad's a politician
Even though picayune
Her mama is of good birth too
But I'm just a musician
From a lovely small town
Playing my instrument is what I do
But I love their daughter
She loves me even more
So I can say that strong is the feeling, yeah
But that is something
They don't seem to really understand
We are alone, me & my darling
Hey, we're way too far away
You're here, so am I
We are together
With our little secret
I'm yours, you are mine
And we're together
That' s our little secret
The night is so beautiful
We're feeling alright
Touching silence all around
Gonna be together
All night long with my love
And listen to the natural sounds
I love their daughter
She loves me even more
So I can say that strong is the feeling, yeah
But that is something
They don't seem to really understand
We are alone, me & my darling
Hey, we're way too far away
You're here, so am I
We are together
With our little secret
I'm yours, you are mine
And we're together
That's our little secret
Repeat
You're here, so am I
We are together
With our little secret
I'm yours, you are mine
Our little secret, me and you, oh yeah            "
