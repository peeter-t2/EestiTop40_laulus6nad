                What`s up 
Come on it`s Friday evening 
Cant wait to go to the party 
I know a place where we all should go 
Check out 
Just around the corner 
Best place can`t be any cooler 
Come along and enter to the party zone 
No suburban angel 
Been in lots of danger 
Once even kicked Bruce Lee 
Hey you, welcome to the party 
Me and girls feeling kinda naughty 
Dealing with hardcore fighting 
Hangin' at the Club Kung-Fu 
Chill out, 'cos you`re at the party 
Me and girls already gettin` started 
Dealing with hardcore fighting 
Hangin' at the Club Kung-Fu 
Zoom this 
You`ll always remember 
What you see can`t get any better 
Hottest people ever seen in whole downtown 
Hear that 
DJ playin' a record 
Best thing after Def Leppard 
Jump up, we`ll be rockin` up this place 
No suburban angel 
Been in lots of danger 
Once even kicked Bruce Lee 
Hey you, welcome to the party 
         ... "
