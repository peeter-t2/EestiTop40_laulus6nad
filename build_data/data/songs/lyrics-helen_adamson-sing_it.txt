                    - Sing it                
                So many times i've been told
what i can and what i can't do
maybe the music's not for you
i've had my pride unfold 
i didn't know if i would follow trough
what my heart told me to do
never am i givin' up
never gonna say goodbye
don't let them see you cry
i hold my head high up
release this feelin' inside
i wanna sing what the word's
can't describe
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaa
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaa
see i've been called so many names
i won't let that define me
for the sake of my dignity
i won't live life ashamed
i'll live to my full capacity
as long as i'm true to me
never am i gonna stop
never have felt so alive
you'll always see me try
i hold my head high up
release this feelin' inside
i wanna sing what the word's
can't describe
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaa
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaa
push, drive, get it do what it takes
push, drive, get it do what it takes
push, drive, get it do what it takes
push, drive, get it, gotta do what it takes
push, drive, get it do what it takes
push, drive, get it do what it takes
push, drive, get it do what it takes
push, drive, get it, gotta do what it takes
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaa
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaa
wanna sing it like
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaa
wanna sing it like
uuuuuuu aaaaaa aaaaaa aaa
wanna sing it like            "
