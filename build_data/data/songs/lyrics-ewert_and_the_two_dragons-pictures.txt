                    Ewert and the Two Dragons
                    - Pictures                
                I remember when I still was young in the sun
I knew hardly any worries
Now the story's changed and all is fading away
Won't you stay until the daybreak?
I was young, I was young
I was young, I was young, I was young
I was young, I was young.
I remember you with your ruby skirt
I was hurt when you wouldn't let me hold you 
Now the story's changed and all is fading away
Won't you stay until the daybreak?
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved til I ran out of love
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved til I ran out of love
I remember us in the autumn rain,
you're the same
it was me who couldn't stay there
and I am leaving today, take the picture from the gold frame
And I learned and I learned
And I learned and I learned
And I learned and I learned til my lesson was learned
And I learned and I learned
And I learned and I learned
And I learned and I learned til my lesson was learned
I take what I need
I ache when I bleed
I'm made this way and you're the same
The IÂ´ll stay
I'll stay when if it's right and leave when it's time
I'm not to blame
The story has changed, has changed
I'm changed
I remember when I still was young in the sun
I knew hardly any worries
Now the story's changed and all is fading away
Won't you stay until the daybreak?
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved til I ran out of love
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved
And I loved and I loved til I ran out of love
And I learned and I learned
And I learned and I learned
And I learned and I learned til my lesson was learned
Pictures, pictures
Black and grey
Fade away
Hold on, hold on
You'll get over it someday
Pictures, pictures
Black and grey
Fade away
Hold on, hold on
You'll get over it someday            "
