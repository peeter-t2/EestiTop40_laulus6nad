                    - Dreams Won’t Come True                
                I want to feel free 
Every single day of my life
Feel the energy inside
I know that I was born for this
Theres a stop-sign in my head
All my dreams shine so red
I know that an average life 
Is no life for me
My life, my friends, my songs, my future
It must go on like this forever
I want to feel free 
Every single day of my life
Feel the energy inside
I know that I was born for this
My mind says its wrong
My home says its wrong
And Im always having second thoughts
But standing here,
Singing this song,
It feels so right
So what the hell it cant be right
But standing here,
Singing this song,
It feels so right
Its gonna be right
It feels so right
Its gonna be right
I want to feel free 
Every single day of my life
Feel the energy inside
I know that I was born for this
I want to feel free 
Every single day of my life
Feel the energy inside
I know that I was born for this
 (I was born for this)"
