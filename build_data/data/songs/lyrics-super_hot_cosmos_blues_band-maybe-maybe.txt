                    - Maybe-Maybe                
                I was happy when you lost your mind
It felt bad when you said you were alright
I went to stand and wait it out
on the corner of a downtown bar
you had to know it took me down
this time you went too far!
I was a man I was eleven feet tall
I went to bed and put my head through the wall
I had to smile and play it cool
While you were having a big cigar
You really had me for a fool
This time you went too far!
Na-na-na-nannaaa! Would you be my baby?
Ye-ye-ye-ye-yeaaah! I´d like to be your man!
Shal-lal-lal-lallaaa! Maybe-maybe-maybe...
I could never tell...
You shook me well!
I was happy and I was blind
I was bad but it never felt alright
I went to stand and wait it out
on the corner of a downtown bar
The cards are on the table
Got nothing more to tell
I don´t know if I´m able
3xREF
You shook me well!            "
