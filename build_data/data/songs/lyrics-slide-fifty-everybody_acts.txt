                    - Everybody Acts                
                Everybody acts the way they do
To be somebody, its true
They say that they dont give a damn
Lies stay and they wont go anywhere
I saw this boy whos never good enough
He was a war, he didnt give a fuck
But in time sadness will bury him alive
Still everybody has their spring of joy
A beautiful smile of a pretty girl
Helps me move on
I have no problem admitting it
A beautiful smile of a pretty girl
Makes me forget all the bad
My next song is gonna be about death and blood
Emotions locked inside
Dead eyes nowhere to hide
Special girls they call themselves
Actually theyre all the same
Devotion is what everybody needs
Sweat, hard work and passion to succeed
Sincere person, impossible to find
Still everybody has their spring of joy
A beautiful smile of a pretty girl
Helps me move on
I have no problem admitting it
A beautiful smile of a pretty girl
Makes me forget all the bad
My next song is gonna be about death and blood
Lies around us, still we enjoy life
A beautiful smile of a pretty girl
Helps me move on
I have no problem admitting it
A beautiful smile of a pretty girl
Makes me forget all the bad
My next song is gonna be about death and blood"
