                    Soul Militia
                    - Freak in me                
                You and me
Feels so good
I like the way you're doin' me
The things you do
It's like you've seen my fantasies
Girl let's take it slow
It can be no more perfect
The candles lit
Can you handle it
Just gotta say god damnit
Shorty's lookin' hot, gotsta have it
Let me put iton you like a G
Bring out the freak in you freak in me
Girl you workin'like a maniac
Got you open let me fill the gap
Tonight's the night let's go crazy
Bring out the freak in you freak in me
Chorus
How do you want it?
From the back
Get on it
Ilike that
Oo yeah, baby that's the spot
Don't stop just ride that(2x)
You're shinin'
Amazing how good love can be so bindin'
Don't let go when we bump and grindin'
Make you scream my name
In all the ways you want it
You're gonna get
Now can you handle it
Leave the windows open
Don't mind the neighbours scopin'
I'ma put it on you like a G
Bring out the freak in you freak in me
Open up and take me in
And when we're done we'll start again
That's just the way it's got tobe
Bring out the freak in you freak in me
Chorus
Bridge
I've been waiting for tonight
So let's waist no time
We can do it all 'til morning
Come lay down here with me
Together we're complete
Be what you wanna be
We freakin'
