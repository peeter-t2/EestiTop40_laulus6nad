                    Claire's Birthday
                    - Ladies Love Me                
                ladies love me I love ladies
I guess that's why they keep sending me photographs
of themself their babyes
the schoolgirls love me they send me photos too
but not with any children involved
they're just nude ooh
I've tried to take it easy god knows I cant
I'm running out of patience enough's enough
I'm tired my love so tired of love my love
all in all I'm just a man simply a man
my father once told me the great fact of his life
he said you can't screw all the women of this world
but least you can do is try
so I've followed his footsteps in every way
by giving all of me to women day after day            "
