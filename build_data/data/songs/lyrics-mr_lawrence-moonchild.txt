                    Mr. Lawrence
                    - Moonchild                
                Trembling to the beat of late October wind 
dressed in dusty rags 
You've been thinking all those years 
Like a golden autumn leaf 
that's trying to set its spirit free 
You've been hiding all those tears 
Just keep the frequency clear 
waiting for Your alien friend 
It makes me wonder 
is there anybody up there 
to hear Your lonely cry 
Twin to my heart You're watching the sky 
dreaming of this yellow land 
And when You get there 
don't you forget to give my regards 
to the moonchild... 
Naked children out of breath 
following the traces in the snow 
You've been running from those fears 
Catching signals getting hope 
recieving trust are we supposed 
to believe in what we hear?            "
