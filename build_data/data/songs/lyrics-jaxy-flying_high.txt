                    - Flying High                
                The way you walk
The way you talk
Yee-eeah...
The way you smile
The way you cry
Yee-eeah...
The way you move
Just the way you do
I want you
I'm losing control 
And I can't go on 
Without you
I'm flying high
Yes I am yes I am
Flying high
I'm flying high
Yes I am yes I am
flying high
I cannot talk
I cannot walk
Like I want to
You make my cry
You are my desire
Oh, how I want u
I'm flying high
Yes I am yes I am
Flying high
I'm flying high
Yes I am yes I am
Flying high
You the eyes I can see
Through the cloves that cover me
You are evereything for me
Just everything I mean everything
Couse when I see you
I'm flying high
Yes I am yes I am
Flying high
I'm flying high
Yes I am yes I am
Flying high            "
