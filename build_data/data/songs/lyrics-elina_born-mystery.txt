                Lalalala...
people pushing me under the gun
sayin I´m the one I am the one
elevatin´ me right to the sun
up to the sun to come undone
with the thrill of thunder
and the pressure I´m under
I hide the fear I hope
you´ll never see
and then at the right time
I´ll get up and I reply
have all the people
watchin´ me
do I ever get to feel
like a queen in a pack of bees
in a pack of bees
I just hope life´s gonna bring
a little more of mystery for me
mystery for me
Lalalala...
I can´t find a single reason why
no reason why under the sky
that I could not escape a simple life
don´t wanna survive I need to thrive
with the thrill of thunder
and the pressure I´m under
I hide the fear I hope
you´ll never see
and then at the right time
I´ll get up and I reply
and all the people
follow me
Mmm
Lalalala
Mmm
Lalalala
Mmm
Lalalala
and then at the right time
I´ll get up and I reply
and all the people
follow me
do I ever get to feel
like a queen in a pack of bees
in a pack of bees
all the drones surroundin´ me
protectin´ me hangin´ on a tree
Mmm
Lalalala
Mmm
Lalalala
Mmm
Lalalala            "
