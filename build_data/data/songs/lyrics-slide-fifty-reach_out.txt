                    - Reach Out                
                Reach out and grab your second chance
You're not alone
Take a deep breath to erase death 
And start another row
Life is a wind and you are a flame still light,
Light, light the way ahead,
Light, light, light the way ahead
Oh please tell me who wrote the books about about our lifetime,
I would like to change a line or two,
Erase the days I said good bye,
Erase the balde the pain, the cry
Where would I be, If you cut from my life
The pain I've been through
Searching for the sky long gone,
Searching for the songs that carry us today
Make a full-stop and do what you should
Kill the world another day
Don't be afraid of the bad
It gives a meaning to good just light a match and stay
Oh please tell me who wrote the books about about our lives,
I would like to change a line or two,
Erase the days I said good bye,
Erase the balde the pain, the cry
Where would I be, If you cut from my life
The pain I've been through
Searching for the sky long gone,
Searching for the songs that carry us today
Where would I be, If you cut from my life
The pain I've been through
Searching for the sky long gone,
Searching for the songs that carry us today
I can't do it on my own,
I can't do it all alone
But I'll try"
