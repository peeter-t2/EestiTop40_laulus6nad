                    Tenfold Rabbit
                    - Oblivion                
                I remember her on the first row
She was staring at me so sweetly
I was sitting with my accordion
So I didn’t think I was cool enough
(x2)
I’ve often wondered
What could have been
But now she’s gone
To the Oblivion
(x4)
I’ve often wondered
What could have been
But now she’s gone
To the Oblivion
(x6)
I’ve often wondered
What could have been
But now she’s gone
To the Oblivion            "
