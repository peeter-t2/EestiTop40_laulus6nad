                    - Stranger                
                Come on lift your face from the mud,
we are born rough,
we are born young.
Baby, you're a wild blue flame,
a little love never hurt anyone.
Come on lift your face from the mud,
we are born rough,
we are born young,
baby, you're a wild blue flame,
a little love never hurt anyone.
I feel like crying but I can't stop dancing
I feel so broken but I can't stop moving on, moving on
because... what doesn't kill us makes us stranger,
what doesn't kill us makes us stranger,
everyone hurts a bit sometimes,
There is a crime in everyone's pure world,
experience - what doesn't kill us makes us stranger,
yeah
Come on lift your face from the mud,
it's not enough and you're not done
baby, you're a wild blue flame,
a little love never hurt anyone.

I feel like crying but I can't stop dancing
I feel so broken but I can't stop moving on, moving on,
as we rise up to the steeple,
yelling out to all the pretty people,
what doesn't kill us makes us stranger,
what doesn't kill us makes us stranger,
everyone hurts a bit sometimes,
there is a crime in everyone's pure world,
experience - what doesn't kill us makes us,
what doesn't kill us breaks us,
what doesn't kill us makes us stranger
So don't be a stranger
don't - don't be a stranger yeah yeah yeah
don't be a stranger
don't - don't be a stranger yeah yeah yeah
I feel like crying but I -
stranger, stranger, stranger
I feel like crying but I -
I feel like crying but I can't stop dancing
I feel like crying but I -
I feel like crying but I -
I feel like crying but I - I, I, I - woo!            "
