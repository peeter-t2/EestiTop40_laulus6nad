                    NOÃ‹P
                    - Move                
                Look me in the eye
And say there's nothing there
You can't, I swear
I double dare
Must I fight every bone in my body
Every time you are near
I would not grab you
And take you away
For how long
Can we say with a long round
Everything that really sounds
From both of our bodies
If it stays the same for too long
It will fade away
But I won't wait until that day comes
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you for forever
Ain't gonna wait until that day
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you either way
Take my hand
And say that you don't feel what I feel
'Cause I see from your eyes
that you do
And that's not right
Even if it feels so
You're someone else's bride
And I can't let go
If it stays the same for too long
It will fade away
But I won't wait until that day comes
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you for forever
Ain't gonna wait until that day
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you either way
Driven by the fear
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you for good
And I feel
That we really belong together
If it stays the same for too long
It will fade away
I won't wait until that day comes
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you for forever
Ain't gonna wait until that day
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you either way
Driven by the fear
If I don't make my move
I'll loose you for good
And I feel
That we really belong together            "
