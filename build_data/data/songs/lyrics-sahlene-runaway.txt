                    - Runaway                
                1.Did somebody dare to tell you what's right
which colours to ware,to laugh or cry
you wanna be fear and maybe you're right
let's burn our fingers,stop the fight
Always driving trough the red line babe,
everybody stops but me
Chorus:Just runaway to the stars
just runaway 'til you're high enough
I will be waiting above
I'll make it happen,I try so hard
2.How lucky you are,your statement is fine
because what you think is what you find
always driving trough red line, babe
everybody stops but me
Ch;
3.Did somebody say it's gonna be easy
'til you get to there you do belong
your newly opened mind explains the reasons
why you have to carry on
Just runaway to the stars....            "
