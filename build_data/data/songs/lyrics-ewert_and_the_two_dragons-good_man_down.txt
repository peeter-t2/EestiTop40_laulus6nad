                    - Good Man Down                
                Here is a story about a boy and a girl
She woke up one morning, felt alone in this world
Despite the love for her, he couldn't keep her from leaving again
She had to do it.
She cried in a night
He brought her flowers in the daytime
She tried and she tried to forget the past and all her past crimes
Despite the love for her, he couldn't keep her from leaving again
She had to do it.
How could you shoot a good man down?
Leave without mourning
Broken-hearted on the ground
Like the others before him
A burden heavy as a rock
ain't nobody gonna stop her
Go ahead and walk alone
and regret it some-else-where
She cried in a night
She got her flowers in the daytime
He gave up the fight while she was out comitting new crimes
Despite the love for her, he couldn't keep her from leaving again
She had to do it.
How could you shoot a good man down?
Leave without mourning
Broken-hearted on the ground
Like the others before him
A burden heavy as a rock
ain't nobody gonna stop her
Go ahead and walk alone
and regret it some-else-where
A burden heavy as a rock
ain't nobody gonna stop her
Go ahead and walk alone
and regret it some-else-where
How could you shoot a good man down?
Leave without mourning
Broken-hearted on the ground
Like the others before him
A burden heavy as a rock
ain't nobody gonna stop her
Go ahead and walk alone
and regret it some-else-where
A burden heavy as a rock
ain't nobody gonna stop her
Go ahead and walk alone
and regret it some-else-where
How could you leave without mourning?
I'm like the others before me.            "
