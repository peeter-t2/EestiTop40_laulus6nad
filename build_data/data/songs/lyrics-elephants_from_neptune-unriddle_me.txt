                    - Unriddle Me                
                NOW LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A SPARK
VOLCANO READY TO SHOOT
AT FIRST I TRIED TO PLAY IT COOL
BUT ENDED UP IN PURSUIT
BE MY SYMPTOM
BE MY KEY
BE MY EVERYTHING
UNRIDDLE ME
WASHED UP UNEXPECTEDLY
I WAS AS DEEP AS CAN BE
WITH MY SENSES BEATING RAPIDLY
I WAS HOOKED SO DESPERATELY
BE MY SYMPTOM
BE MY KEY
BE MY EVERYTHING
UNRIDDLE ME
DEFINE THE WORLD WITH ME
EXPLAIN THE UNEXPLAINED
SIT SIDE BY SIDE WITH ME
FOREVER PLAY YOUR GAME
BE MY SYMPTOM
BE MY KEY
BE MY EVERYTHING
UNRIDDLE ME            "
