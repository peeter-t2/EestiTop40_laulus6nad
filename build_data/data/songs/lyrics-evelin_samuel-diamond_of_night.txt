                    - Diamond of Night                
                Silently glowing moonbeams are sowing 
Silver silver starry-eyed skies 
Words of desire burning in fire 
Linger linger long in disguise 
Diamond of night 
Burning so bright 
Guide me my silvery new sign 
Finding my way 
As I pray 
Now I can say it is my time 
Voices are calling with stardust falling 
Reveries reveries lighten his heart 
Silently blazing stars so amazing 
Heavenly heavenly fire from a spark 
Diamond of night 
Burning so bright 
Guide me my silvery new sign 
Finding my way 
As I pray 
Now I can say it is my time 
Diamond of night 
Burning so bright 
Guide me my silvery new sign 
Finding my way 
As I pray 
Now I can say it is my time 
Diamond of night 
Burning so bright 
Now I can say it is my time            "
