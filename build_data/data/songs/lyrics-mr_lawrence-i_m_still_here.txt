                    Mr. Lawrence
                    - I'm Still Here                
                are you lucky are you happy
with that ruthless thunder inside
is it dazing perhaps distracting
how bad does it hurt when you're down
don't you dare
give in to fear
cause honey I'm still here
disappointed you feel tainted
how could somebody else steal the show
burns and crashes blinding flashes
it's not fair to have things turned this way
don't you dare
give in to fear
I'm asking you now
don't you dare
fall into tears
cause honey I'm still here
hey there hey there
what are you gonna do
hey there hey there
is it them versus you
are you rising against all odds
voices voices hear these voices
on an old phonographic machine
it's strange to follow a 60's record
to turn someone's world upside down
trained for fun and easy go's
you came to see some skin and bones
to realize it ain't no pleasuredome
same old freeway a faster lane
keeps you warm for one more day
then leaves you blank with nothin' more to say            "
