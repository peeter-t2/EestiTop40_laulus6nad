                    - Believe me when I wish good luck                
                Please help me 
But I can't see what I can do for you
There is nothing, I'm nothing
Believe me when I wish good luck
Decive me when I wish too much
I am here but I can't reach you
Sitting right here, still I can't reach you
I am here but I can't reach you,
Sitting here, still I can't reach you
Just open your mouth, wrong
Open your blouse, no
Open you heart, wrong
There is nothing you can do
I am here but I can't reach you
Sitting right here still I can't reach you
I am here but I can't reach you
Sitting right here still I can't reach you
Believe me when I wish good luck
Decive me when I wish too much
Believe me when I wish good luck
Decive me when I wish too much
Try again, fly again
Try again, fly again
Try again            "
