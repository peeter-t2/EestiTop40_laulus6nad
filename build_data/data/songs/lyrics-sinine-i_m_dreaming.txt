                    - I'm Dreaming                
                now all my feelings filled with blue
and all my mind is filled with you
three candles, waterpipe and you
red wine, red rose, and me and you
I see the look in your shining eyes
yes I know, yes we know
I see the tears in your beautiful eyes
tonight may be the last one
don´t leave me alone
I´m dreaming I´m dreaming I´m dreaming of you, me, our life
I´m dreaming I´m dreaming I´m dreaming of you, me, our life
my blue, my red will guide to who?
the words I sing were once for you
now I have found my way back home
red wine, red rose, and me and You
I´m dreaming I´m dreaming I´m dreaming of you, me, our life
I´m dreaming I´m dreaming I´m dreaming of you, me, our life
now you cry
slowly fly
like the yellow butterfly
slowly fly
in my dreams
in my sky
now you cry
slowly die
like the yellow butterfly
slowly die
in my dreams
in my mind            "
