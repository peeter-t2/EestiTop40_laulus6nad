                Shake your bones
Shake your bones
Do the dance
Take a chance
Check your soul
Check your soul
Fall in love
Fall in love
Some things you never say
Stick with you ‘til the end
Some things you never say
Say another thousand words
Classic dreams to classy girls
Say another thousand words
The pretty ones not the kind that hurt
Some things you never say
Stick with you ‘til the end
Some things you never say
I’m alone
I’m alone
And it’s not fun
It’s not fun
And it’s your song
It’s your song
Just be the one
Just be the one
Some things you never say
Stick with you ‘til the end
Some things you never say
2xREF
Say another thousand words
Classic dreams
Classy girls
Say another thousand words
