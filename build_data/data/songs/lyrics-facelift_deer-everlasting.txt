                Welcome to my world and close the door
in case they slips in before
you do
i'd gladly be the fool and make the move
togo and try to get the moon
for you
everlasting night 
everlasting night...
everlasting night
everlasting night
hoped that tomorrow wouldn't kill the fun
i tried to block the morning sun
from you
i can not tell if it was real or not
was i the one to make this up?
take a step-off the ground
in the night we're safe and sound
everlasting night (4x)
it's an everlasting night 
everlasting night (4x)            "
