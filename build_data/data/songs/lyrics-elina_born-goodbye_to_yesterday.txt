                    - Goodbye to yesterday                
                I woke up 6 AM
My eyes were closed
But my mind was awake
Pretended I was breathing
In a deep sleep pace
Got dressed so quietly
I was frozen by the jingle 
Of my keys at the door
As I got outside
I smiled to the dog
I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm pretty sure
I would have told you to stop
Let's try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday
Why would you think like that?
Yeah we fight a lot but in the end
You and I we're a perfect match
I wouldn't want it any other way
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
Lying here naked and staring at the phone
I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm pretty sure
I would have told you to stop
Let's try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday
I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm pretty sure
I would have told you to stop
Let's try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday
Goodbye to yesterday
Goodbye to yesterday            "
