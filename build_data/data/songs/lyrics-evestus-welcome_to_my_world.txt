                    - Welcome To My World                
                Welcome to the reason
Power of the mind
Welcome to Democracy and
Justice that is blind
Welcome to religion
Everyone is wrong
There's no cure for cancer
welcome to the atom bomb
Welcome to my world
Welcome to the hunger
Welcome to the pain
Welcome to the wars we wage to
make them go away
Welcome to the riots
Welcome to the change
Welcome to corruption
Everything will stay the same
Welcome to my world
come take a look before I blow it up again            "
