                    Nightlight Duo
                    - Another Country Song                
                After working hard
After sweat and blood
After a long rainy day
All of us know
Where to go
There's a place just on the way
The time has come to set things right
We leave our worries behind
And start to dance, so take the change
And be as you want to be
In this old saloon
Where time is flying by
Now time is right to celebrite
All troubles vanish soon
And worries get sick and die
C: C'mon it's party time
For a nickel or a dime
We get all the fun
The show is going on
We all feelin' groovy
While the band is playing
This country song.
Some of us are tired
Some of us were fired
But not with a cannon or gun
So no harm done, 
Be it thus - 
There is still a place for usIn this old saloon
Where time is flying by
Now time is right to celebrite
All troubles vanish soon
And worries get sick and die
C: C'mon it's party time
For a nickel or a dime
We get all the fun
The show is going on
We all feelin' groovy
While the band is playing
This country song."
