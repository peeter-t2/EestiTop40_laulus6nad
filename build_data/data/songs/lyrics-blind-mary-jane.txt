                    Blind
                    - Mary-Jane                
                I cant understand 
Why my life goes like this 
One step up & huge step down 
I cant understand 
Why say no way 
Mary Jane 
You are my Mary-Jane 
Im waiting for you 
Theres no one around 
And I think its time for 
You to come and never leave 
I cant understand 
Why say no way 
Mary Jane 
You are my Mary-Jane 
Im waiting for you 
Oh my marmalade 
Sweeter than chocolate 
Her majesty herself will never 
Mean as much to anyone as 
You - say no way 
Mary Jane 
You are my Mary-Jane 
Im waiting for you 
I dont care much who you are 
As long as you dont come from yesterday 
You are my Mary-Jane 
Im waiting for you            "
