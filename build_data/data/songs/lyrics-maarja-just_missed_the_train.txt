                    - Just missed the train                
                Roll over, baby
The time has come
To make a little bit more room
I've hung around you
It's getting tough
I think i'm gonna breakdown soon
I remember
Crying in the park
It was getting dark
Suddenly i looked up
You were my sky
(chorus)
So sleep, darling'
Oh please don't pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm so sorry We got to the station a little to late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train
Be quiet, angel
Don't make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh, can't you see me through the clouds
Trying hard to find my way
Do you remember
Drinking all that wine
We were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk a line
We were alright
(chorus)
Oh, Why'd that train just pass us by
Didn't anyone see we were stuck at the light
Or we would've made it on time            "
