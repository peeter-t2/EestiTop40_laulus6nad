                    - When the indians cry                
                Babe, tell me where 
Will you sleep tonight 
For there\'s such a pain in my heart 
And I got a flame 
That\'s dying inside 
And I dream that we\'ll soon have to part 
When the Indians cry 
And the eagles die 
\'Cos the winds of change 
Blow again 
Then I\'ll know that you 
Turned the world into blue 
And my tears will fall like the rain 
Love can be so cruel 
When the light of hope is gone 
I know \'cos I felt it before 
In the desert of fear 
I can hear this old song 
Of a love that won\'t live anymore 
When the Indians cry 
And the eagles die 
\'Cos the winds of change 
Blow again 
Then I\'ll know that you 
Turned the world into blue 
And my tears will fall like the rain "
