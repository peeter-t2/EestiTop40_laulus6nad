                    - Hero                
                Sweet and tender
Happy ender
Oh I wonder what it takes
Keep it simple
Quick and nimble
All the small things to make my day
Cause we all need a miracle
Oh we just need a hero
You make hard things
Look like child play
You are more than meets the eye
When you staring like its magic 
Hope that best days yet to come
Cause we all need a miracle
Oh we just need a hero
Sweet and tender
Happy ender
Oh I wander what it takes
Keep it simple
Quick and nimble
All the small things to make my day
If you all make a difference
Then we all can be heroes
Cause we all need a miracle (need a miracle, need a miracle)
Oh we just need a hero (need a hero, need a hero)
Cause we all need a miracle (need a miracle, need a miracle)
Oh we just need a hero (need a hero, need a hero)
(Need a hero, need a hero, need a heroÂ….)"
