                    - Tik Tak                
                time now makes a tik-tak
in life still no click-clack
what later it brings back?
lets talk about - all about
child twitching on the floor
feels ashamed for opinion
having doubt in her faith
wanna talk about?
love hides form the trust
all alone in the game
thats the price of our shame
lets talk about - all about
praying on your knees and asking
trying, lying, dieing, crying
and asking you for tomorrow
gunshot!
using up the law curing the state
whats the price of your rate
lets talk about - all about
hate now makes a tik-tak
in brain still no click-clack
what the fuck it brings back
wanna talk about? - all about"
