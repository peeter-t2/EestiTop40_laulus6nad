                    - Destiny                
                Welcome to the highest state of illusion,
inside my mind.
It's like a ravishing delusion,
of modern times.
Don't know if tomorrow,
brings happiness or sorrow.
No one knows the truth, but you...
Tell me, is it my destiny ?
To know life long before.
Tomorrow's history.
We are strangers and lovers,
facing each other,
standing at the gates of time.
Do we turn back or go with the flow.
We just don't know, we just don't know.
Yes I know it's technological wonder,
I read your mind.
Who will survive ?
Who torn asunder ?
Try to be kind.
Don't know if tomorrow,
brings happiness or sorrow.
Robots cannot lie, you must...
Tell me, is it my destiny ?
To know life long before.
Tomorrow's history.
We are strangers and lovers, 
facing each other, 
standing at the gates of time.
Do we turn back or go with the flow. 
We just don't know, we just don't know.
You can't fake it.
You can't show it.
You need to decide which way you go.
You can't fake it.
You can't show it.
You need to decide which way you go.
Tell me, is it my destiny ?
To know life long before.
Tomorrow's history.
We are strangers and lovers,
facing each other,
standing at the gates of time.
Do we turn back or go with the flow.
We just don't know, we just don't know.            "
