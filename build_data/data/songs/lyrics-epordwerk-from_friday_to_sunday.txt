                    - From Friday To Sunday                
                It all started with a trip to a fancy bar
I called my best friends and took off with a car
Every weekend without sundays
That's the price that partying pays
The worse part and the worse start
Is a death from your own credit card
We wanna party here, we wanna party there
Cause when the beat starts moving and you head keeps grooving hey-yeah
To the music, that's so amusing, you better use it
We wanna party here, we wanna party there
Cause when the beat starts moving and you head keeps grooving hey-yeah
To the music, that's so amusing, you better use it
The way you move your body it turns me on like hell
I just wanna study your bodies every cell
Tonight there's nothing stopping us for knowing well
You got me popping up like a crazy town
These special lights await, i'm feeling on the room
Those hips are shaking right, tonight were
We wanna party here, we wanna party there
Cause when the beat starts moving and you head keeps grooving hey-yeah
To the music, that's so amusing, you better use it
We wanna party here, we wanna party there
Cause when the beat starts moving and you head keeps grooving hey-yeah
To the music, that's so amusing, you better use it
To the music, so amusing
We wanna party here, we wanna party there
Cause when the beat starts moving and you head keeps grooving hey-yeah
To the music, that's so amusing, you better use it
We wanna party here, we wanna party there
Cause when the beat starts moving and you head keeps grooving hey-yeah
To the music, that's so amusing, you better use it            "
