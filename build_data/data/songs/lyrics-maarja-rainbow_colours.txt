                    - Rainbow Colours                
                Two hours since you went away
already feels like seven days
I can't say that I'm unhappy though
I just hate it when you have to go
If it's one in a million
It's a race against time
It's a case of who's winning
Some of us loose, but I find!
You are my rainbow colours
when the autumn brings me rain
Giving me rainbow colours
love is born again
You are my rainbow colours
like the light upon my way
Giving me rainbow colours
every night and day
Cause love is hard to find
and who can say you're mine?
Yes love is hard to find
cause you! everything is you!
And love is hard to find
and who can say you're mine?
Yes love is hard to find
and all you do, is for me and you
Don't need some high society
or any kind of misery
All things I ever dreamt to own
is right here when you're coming home
If it's one in a million
You will always be mine
It's a case of who's winning
Some of us loose, but I find!
You are my rainbow colours
when the autumn brings me rain
Giving me rainbow colours
love is born again
You are my rainbow colours
like the light upon my way
Giving me rainbow colours
every night and day
Cause love is hard to find
and who can say you're mine?
Yes love is hard to find
cause you! everything is you!
And love is hard to find
and who can say you're mine?
Yes love is hard to find
all you do, is for me and you
If it's one in a million
It's a race against time
It's a case of who's winning
Some of us loose, but I find!            "
