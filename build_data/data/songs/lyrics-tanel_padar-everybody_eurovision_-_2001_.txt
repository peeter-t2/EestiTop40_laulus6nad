                Every night's a Friday night
Ladies, this sure feels right
The two of us will sing again
The heart is young and we know when
So kick the sadness out the door
And roll the carpet from the floor
So let the spirit hit the roof
The two of us still know the moves
Not even time can take away
The starlight from us, no, it won't fade
Still we believe that we
Were made to laugh and sing
Come on, everybody let's sing along
And feel the power of the song
Come on, everybody let's feel the spark
That always stays within our hearts
Come on, everybody and let it out
Live the moment here and now
Come on, everybody cause here's a chance
To feel so light, to laugh and dance
A little rollercoaster ride
Right into the starry night
Leave the windows open wide
And let the music pour inside
Not even time can take away
The starlight from us, no, it won't fade
Still we believe that we
Were made to laugh and sing
Come on, everybody let's sing along
And feel the power of a song
Come on, everybody let's feel the spark
That always stays within our hearts
Come on, everybody and let it out
Live the moment here and now
Come on, everybody cause here's a chance
To feel so light, to laugh and dance
Look at us now, here together again
We started out long time ago, we knew back then
The music within us could never, could never end
Come on, everybody let's sing along
And feel the power of a song
Come on, everybody let's feel the spark
That always stays within our hearts
Come on, everybody and let it out
Live the moment here and now
Come on, everybody cause here's a chance
To feel so light, to laugh and dance            "
