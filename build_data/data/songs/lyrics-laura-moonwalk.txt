                    - Moonwalk                
                I'm trying to escape, there's no need to explain
Reaching for the moon, I'm flying away
Counting the time, back to year sixty-nine
\"We come in peace\", echoes my mind
You're my sattellite, in dark, cold night
Up to the stars, reaching for life
And now I take my apollo for a flight
Tonight I'm taking my moonwalk
Sun goes round me, the earth is out of sight
Tonight I'm taking my moonwalk
If I let the lightyears pass me by
I'm free, stop hiding your feelings
Here's my chance to say what's on my mind
In the ocean of space, I made a mistake
I lost my sunshine, while running away
Alone in the dark on this higher ground
I want to come back, do you read me now
You're my sattellite, in dark, cold night
Up with the stars, I miss the daylight
And now I take my apollo for a flight
Tonight I'm taking my moonwalk
Sun goes round me, the earth is out of sight
Tonight I'm taking my moonwalk
If I let the lightyears pass me by
I'm free, stop hiding your feelings
Here's my chance to say what's on my mind
You're my sattellite, in dark, cold night
Up to the stars, reaching for life
You're my sattellite, in dark, cold night
(Up to the stars, reaching for life)
And now I take my apollo for a flight
Tonight I'm taking my moonwalk
Sun goes round me, the earth is out of sight
Tonight I'm taking my moonwalk
If I let the lightyears pass me by
I'm free, stop hiding your feelings
Here's my chance to say what's on my mind
I'm taking my moonwalk...             "
