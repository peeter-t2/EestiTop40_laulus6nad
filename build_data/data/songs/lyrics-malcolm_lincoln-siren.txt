                    - Siren                
                Siren in my head, is making awful sound.
It's time to make it clear-what is lost
and what is found?
My life has been oh lame,
has been oh lame so far.
I waisted years, I waisted time,
trying to reach the starts. 
My life has been oh lame,
has been oh lame so far.
2X
Give me time and give me strenght,
give me strenght to carry on. 
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night.
Siren in my head, yes I can hear it again.
Is it just the beginning, or is it the end?
My life has been oh lame,
has been oh lame so far.
I waisted years, I waisted time,
trying to reach the starts. 
My life has been oh lame,
has been oh lame so far.
4X
Give me time and give me strenght,
give me strenght to carry on.
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night.            "
