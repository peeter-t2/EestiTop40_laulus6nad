                    White High, The
                    - Party People                
                Party people coming to my place, it's Friday night again..
Cocktails, whiskey, rum and beer that's all we're gonna need.
The boys are getting high and the girls they're getting frisky
TV`s on and music's loud, it's time to dance together.
But you should know
That I am here 
Waiting you again
I can't take this anymore, babe!
Release my hair, undress me now. We're getting closer.
Touch my lips and read my mind 
You should know my name by now... I am the only girl 
who  makes your heart go upside down, yeah...
Take a ride with me boy...
The night is full of laughter and loads of alcohol
When I see you laughing it makes me feel so good.
For me you're the air and energy that I am gasping.
Your eyes are key to every woman's heart and I'm not lying.
But you should know
That I am here 
Waiting you again
I can't take this anymore, babe!
Release my hair, undress me now. We're getting closer.
Touch my lips and read my mind 
You should know my name by now... I am the only girl 
who  makes your heart go upside down, yeah...
Take a ride with me boy...
SCREAM:
Are you fucking crazy?
Is this what you call a party?
Where are all the people?
And where the hell are you?
But you should know
That I am here 
Waiting you again
I can't take this anymore, babe!
Release my hair, undress me now. We're getting closer.
Touch my lips and read my mind 
You should know my name by now... I am the only girl 
who  makes your heart go upside down, yeah...
Take a ride with me boy...            "
