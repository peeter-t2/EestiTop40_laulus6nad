                    - Queen Of The Night                
                (Chorus:)
Look at her heart - it's cold as ice,
but eyes are burning.
Every part of hers is like a spice,
that makes you dirty.
Queen of the night...(2x)
She doesn't know the glow of moon.
She doesn't need realise shadows
following her through the night.
She's burning with the brightest flame
by trying to forget all yesterdays.
Her body stops, the warning rising
You're always on a way she came from
and why you never see her alone
With that a hesitation you'll see Queen of the night.
(Chorus:)
Look at her heart - it's cold as ice,
but eyes are burning.
Every part of hers is like a spice,
that makes you dirty
(2x)
You often wished to be like her
Then suddenly you landing in  her world.
They cry for help to heaven wake-up-call.
You're always on a way she came from
and why you never see her alone
With that a hesitation you'll see Queen of the night.
Queen of the night...(4x)
(Chorus:)
Look at her heart - it's cold as ice,
but eyes are burning.
Every part of hers is like a spice,
that makes you dirty.
(2x)
that makes you dirty(2x)"
