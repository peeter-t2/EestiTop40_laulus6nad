                    - THE OUTSIDER                
                I've tried to fit my life to this
Life in a foreign place
Adopt their ways and customs oh so strange
I've tried to get rid of my past
Forget where I am from
Forget what I once had and what I've done
All that I once just left behind and pushed aside
All that was part of me, I shouldn't have let it die
I gotta find my way back home
I can't stand a day more alone
I hope it's not too late
I still wait
For the day that I'm back home
Tired of rigid fuck-off glares
They cut me just too deep
There's no love in them and there's no warmth
Tired of running against that wall
But walls are everywhere
There's no sympathy, there's no support
Their roads are all too even
All too straight and fine
Their grass is all too green and
Sun is much too bright
I gotta find my way back home
I can't stand a day more alone
I hope it's not too late
I still wait
For the day
I wanna be back in my village
Where I left my kin, my home
Back in the places
Where I once used to go
Back in my village
Where I left my friends, my love
That's where my mind takes me
When the silence comes
Repeat
I gotta find my way back home
I can't stand a day more alone
I hope it's not too late
I still wait
For the day that I'm back home
Repeat
I gotta find my way back home
I can't stand a day more alone
I hope it's not too late
That's where my mind takes me
When the silence comes            "
