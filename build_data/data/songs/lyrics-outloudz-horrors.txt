                    - Horrors                
                I've been waiting for my horrors
for them to leave me be in my sorrows
Can't seem to shake them off my body 
gonna make you rock your own body
You're my kind of girl 2x
You make me forget all the horrors 2x
You're my kind of girl 2x
You make me forget all the horrors 2x
I've been meaning to give you a call
but it's not too soon, gotta keep it cool
I find the things you do ....(?)
You're my kind of girl 2x
You make me forget all the horrors 2x
You're my kind of girl 2x
You make me forget all the horrors 2x
3x            "
