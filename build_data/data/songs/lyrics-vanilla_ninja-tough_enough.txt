                    Vanilla Ninja
                    - Tough Enough                
                Baby only the strong would survive
Over mysteries of life
Only fantasy keeps you away
In the
lonely fields of those broken shields
[Chorus]
So keep on kicking
The bomb is ticking
Don`t
stop, don`t be a runaway
Go for the fire
Baby are you tough enough
Just keep on living
And
don`t start giving
The devil good reasons
To get you in the seasons of heartbreak
Baby are
you tough enough
[Baby are you tough enough]
Yeah my skin is a dangerous place
Never trust
my smiling face
With a touch I can change all your dreams
And my kiss can wake feelings you can`t
take
[Chorus]
[Baby are you tough enough]
[Baby are you tough enough]
[Bridge]
I
will meet you there
cousd I need you there
Oh tonight
[Chorus]
[Baby are you tough enough]
[Baby
are you tough enough]
[Chorus]
Baby are you tough enough"
