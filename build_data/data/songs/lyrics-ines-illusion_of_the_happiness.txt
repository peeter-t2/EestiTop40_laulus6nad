                    - Illusion Of The Happiness                
                I'm sitting alone right here 
I keep all your letters lying by my bed 
But maybe I've understood you wrong 
What takes you so long
I have never felt so sad 
Reality strikes - it sometimes really hurts 
I must be a fool to love you 
Like crazy for so long 
But there ain't nothing more to say 
You took for granted love I gave 
And there ain't noone else to blame 
Illusion of the happiness oohh
You ask, am I afraid today 
I've waited so long this love to fade away 
By now I have come to the end of a life 
There is no more time
You do not believe I could ever leave you 
But you're wrong
But there ain't nothing more to say 
You took for granted love I gave 
And there ain't no one else to blame 
Illusion of the happiness oohh 
But there ain't nothing more to say 
You talk to me don't call don't stay
This is my only way to end my 
Illusion of the happiness
I don't warm when my life is going 
What's behind those eyes so blue 
Tell me what you're feeling oh baby 
Tell me we're through 
I'm not completely over you
But there ain't nothing
But there ain't... 
Illusion of the happiness"
