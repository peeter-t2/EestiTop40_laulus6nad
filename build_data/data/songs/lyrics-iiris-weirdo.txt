                    - Weirdo                
                Come on now
Lose the crown
The bling and the poise
And a head full of fright
Hear it, oh
Mind no fault
Everything’s gonna
Be alright
Tell me what you do to me
Is this a prophecy?
You weirdo
Weirdo
If you think you move wrong
Baby we can groove on
Feel the beat
We don’t hate
We’ve got unicorn love
Feel it out
Here’s the sound
And all I wanna be is here and now
Hear me baby
All you do is golden 
move your body
origami folding
Tell me what you do to me
Is this a prophecy?
You weirdo
Weirdo
Tell me what you do to me
Is this a prophecy?
You weirdo
Weirdo
Tell me baby all you do is golden
Move my body
Origami folding
Tell me baby all you do is golden
Move my body
Origami folging
Tell me what you do to me
Is this a prophecy?
You weirdo
Weirdo
Tell me what you do to me
Is this a prophecy?
You weirdo
You weirdo
Tell me what you do to me
Is this a prophecy?
You weirdo
Weirdo
Tell me what you do to me
Is this a prophecy?
You weirdo
Weirdo            "
