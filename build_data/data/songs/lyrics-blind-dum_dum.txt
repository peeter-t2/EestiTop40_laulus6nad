                    Blind
                    - Dum Dum                
                You walk, you even talk, 
But you just don't have any brains 
You breathe, you even see, 
But you just don't have any brains 
You're so great I get laid every day - 
You make me happy 
You're so great I get laid every day - 
You make me so happy 
Hey, hey 
It's okay 
Hey, hey 
It's okay 
You are so dumdum 
That words couldn't say 
But if you'll marry me, 
Then it's okay 
Those fools! Who always panic 
When they can't find any brains 
But me! I like you manically 
I'm not one bit afraid 
You're so great & I sure wouldn't trade 
You for nothing 
You're so great I get laid every day - 
You make me so happy            "
