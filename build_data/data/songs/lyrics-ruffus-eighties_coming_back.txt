                    - Eighties Coming Back                
                you thought you had it coming 
but now you really really just dont know 
it seems you make a deal far too big outta this 
you thought that youd done it
jeah you thought that you had heard it all 
but the state of things is putting you down now just because 
you know they say it's just the eighties coming back 
jeah it feels just like the eighties coming back 
aw i know it's just the eighties coming 
eighties coming eighties coming 
eighties coming eighties coming back 
you said lets do it 
let's take it out and dance all night 
but those deep synthesizersounds freak you out 
now you wake up in the middle of the night 
in terror all you do is cry 
cold sweat a cup of tea no nothing seems to help you 
thru the night 
my god 
you know they say it's just the eighties coming back 
jeah it feels just like the eighties coming back 
aw i know it's just the eighties coming 
eighties coming eighties coming 
eighties coming eighties coming back 
yeah you thought you had it coming but now it looks like you didn't know this 
but everybody's wearing their hair the way you did 
15 years ago 
you know they say it's just the eighties coming back "
