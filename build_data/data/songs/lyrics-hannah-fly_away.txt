                    - Fly Away                
                Days passing by
Always near by your side
Sometimes joy sometimes pain
But some things never change
And now when I’m gone
You looking for my love
It’s like the end of my days
And I wish that I could fly away
And now when I’m gone 
You looking for my love
I feel like end of my days 
And I wish that I could fly away
Nights are cold and dark
Still I miss to be in your arms
Sometimes joy sometimes pain
But some things never change
And now when I’m gone 
You looking for my love
It’s like the end of my days 
And I wish that I could fly away
And now when I’m gone 
You looking for my love
I feel like end of my days 
And I wish that I could fly away            "
