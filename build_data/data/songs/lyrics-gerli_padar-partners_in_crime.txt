                    - Partners in Crime                
                Were standing in the rain
And sipping cold champagne
The night is full of angels of sin -
The demons of pleasure and pain
You whisper in my ear
Im holding back the tears
Your words are burning the way to my heart
Thats been held hostage for years
The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we can not deny
Well always be partners in crime
I kiss your lips so sweet
Do you feel the heat
Is it so wrong to be hungry for love
To follow the passion so deep
Now its too late to turn back the time
We just have to go with the flow
I will be yours and you will be mine
And thats how            "
