                    Ewert and the Two Dragons
                    - (In the End) There's Only Love                
                shake me up from the dreams
life is only worth
when yoou gave it away
and when you're done you've learned
there is nothing that's greater
and there is nothing that weighs
more
cos you grow and you grow
and with years you'll know
there is only one thing
in the end to show
you do it wrong again and again
til it's too late to stop and then
oo-oo
you look into their eyes
oo-oo
but you can't stop your lies
oo-oo
and then you're all alone at nights
all you wanted from me 
was a gift of love
but for reasons unknown
you said i wastoo far 
i felt i cannot come closer
then you said it was over
i really tried when isaid
i did my best
â€“ i guess i thought
you'll do the rest
we will meet in the corner
cos together is warmer
oo-oo
then the feelig starts
oo-oo
and it fills you heart
oo-oo
and in the end there's only love            "
