                    O3
                    - Sun                
                Why does this place distract me
why world wants to use me
raise up your hands and fight
and be who you like
why don't you ever like me
you always wanna fight with me
try to understand me
please don't protect me
you leave on your own way
never try to explain
your pretty eyes want to lie to me
but your mouth again suprise me
i hear the voice that scares
and my lips are cold again
and my eyes can see things
you call this, the disease
sun, every time you come
you can see the land
you can see the land
where i wanna go
all my life i'm defending
i live the way you tell me
piss off everything i have
shit on you and later eat it
my hands are like the spades
i feel pain in my face
my feet are stuck
but my brain is still alive
sun, every time you come
you can see the land
you can see the land
where i wanna go
please don't make me cry
i'm just a little sweet child
please don't hit me again
i'll do everything you say
i want out of this game
i'm closed in this frame
only way to escape
when the sun shows me the way
sun, every time you come
you can see the land
you can see the land
where i wanna go            "
