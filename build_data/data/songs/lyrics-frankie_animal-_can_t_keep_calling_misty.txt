                    - (Can't Keep Calling) Misty                
                You were my lover for a long time 
Couldn’t see any other
Think it’s better that it’s dead now
But I still discover
Though I know I’m not the only one
With my heart in the rubble
You remind me of a good time
Guess I’m livin’ in a bubble
And I know i’m not the only one
And that you’re zipping from another
Still trouble in my young heart
That ain’t gettin’ any younger
4xCan't keep calling Misty
You were my lover for a long time
Didn’t need any other
Think it’s better that it’s dead now
For I still discover
That I know you’re not the only one
I want a love not a lover
I still hope and I wonder
And keep calling on your number
And I know you’re not the only one
I’m off better I’m stronger
It’s still trouble in my young heart
That ain’t getting any younger
4xREF
Sunny days in my bed now
Can’t talk to you Misty
4 years through my head now
I still want you listening
And though I know you’re not the only one
I’m off better with another
But I want no other I can’t see any other
I don’t need any other
Will ever be no other
8xREF            "
