                Don´t make me see that smile on your face
I´m the better faker can you belive
Oh yes I am by the way
Take a good look in the mirror today
Do you really like what you see
You´re disgraced look at me
Doesn´t feel like home I won't open the door
I don´t wanna save the world anymore
I´m breaking the rules again
What is yours you'll never lose
I´m making new rules again
It´s up to you which way you choose 
I´m breaking the rules again
What is your´s you´ll never lose
I don`t answer the calls the calls so now
I´m crashing the walls around
Wanna hit the road this is highway to nowhere
Don´t wanna start all over again 
You always point the finger at me
Someone else is to blame
It´s just like one more senselessday
Another wasted weekend you see
It´s all wrong it´s too late
Doesn´t feel like home I won't open the door
I don´t wanna save the world anymore
I´m breaking the rules again
What is yours you'll never lose
.....
Some people always stay around
So keep you´r feet down on the ground
Some people laugh it´s way too loud
Don´t like that sound
I´m breaking the rules again
What is yours you'll never lose
.....            "
