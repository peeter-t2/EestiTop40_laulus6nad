                    - To hurt somebody                
                I've been searching for you and calling you all day 
Was it one night stand or  you just couldn't stay?
Maybe you were too afraid to have a friend 
Cause that friend maybe one day your loving man 
I have seen it many times before last night 
do you really think it was a coincidence 
I've been waiting when I'll meet you face to face 
cause I've dreamed about you, honey, for million years 
To hurt somebody, 
it's not a pleasure to everybody 
To hate somebody, 
doesn't make you feel good 
To love somebody, 
it's a pleasure to everybody 
To hold somebody, 
it will make you feel good 
The woonds I heal when I still think of you 
For my soul, that is breathing, i'm gettin over you 
For the lies that are over everything that's true (?) 
Cause my crying angel and my happy moods
I'm singing aroun my empty room 
Trying to find a piece of you 
Calling your name but you're not here 
Why did you slipped away ?
I've been searching for you and calling you all day 
Was it one night stand or you just couldn't stay?
Maybe you were too afraid to have a friend 
Cause that friend maybe one day your loving man 
To hurt somebody, 
it's not a pleasure to everybody 
To hate somebody, 
doesn't make you feel good 
To love somebody, 
it's a pleasure to everybody 
To hold somebody, 
it will make you feel good 
To hurt somebody, 
it's not a pleasure to everybody 
To hate somebody, 
doesn't make you feel good 
To love somebody, 
it's a pleasure to everybody 
To hold somebody, 
it will make you feel good
