                    - That's All Because Of You                
                That's all because of you
Wake up in the morning straight to the sunshine, yee
listen to the radio favourite song
try to find the certain book with an attitude
but there are things i just like to do after all
Chorus:
Come on baby, please, please turn it on
cause radio plays our favourite song
our Dj played that on and on
i wonder what i feel
Come on baby, please, please turn it on
cause radio plays our favourite song
I lose my nerve, try to find the words
but no use, that's all because of you
I would like the coffee, black 
just like black & white, oh yee
i should speak all up in the same way too
all confusions, feelings, also like love and hate
yes, i've been so patient, 
but this situation stay the same
Chorus
But every word means so much, 
i can't get you out of my mind
but every word means so much
every life is once in a life
come on come on come on, baby
Chorus (2x)
That's all because of you            "
