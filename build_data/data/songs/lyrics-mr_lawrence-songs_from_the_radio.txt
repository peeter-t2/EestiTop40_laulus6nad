                    - Songs From The Radio                
                down by the corner there lives a boy
keeps himself occupied with elecronic toys
he's spending the days and wasting the nights
layin' low in the neon lights
fix the world with a remote control
he wants to heal his hurts
with good old rock'n'roll
surfs the airwaves bright eyes open wide
to find the answer
from time to time he sings
songs he knows from the radio
dear mr. nighthawk can you put me on
I've got the strangest suicide philosophy
the minute you get even and you think you're dead
you become a supersaint instead
years will go by he'll soon become a man
with countless possessions and a chevy van
there will be many ways to make it through the night
he won't give a shit about the neon lights
he'll find the answer
from time to time he'll sing
songs he knows from the radio
and he'll be
layin' low in the neon lights            "
