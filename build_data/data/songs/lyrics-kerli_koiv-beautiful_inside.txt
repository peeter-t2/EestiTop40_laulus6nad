                    - Beautiful Inside                
                Is it cold where I`ll be tonight
I should say that I dont care at all
Do I have a place to sleep at night
Well, you should know that I dont care at all
You wont hear me cry
Because I dont care at all
Im beautiful inside
And I just dont care at all
If U`ll take me away
Whatever U do
Whatever U say
I dont care about me
I dont care about U
I dont know what is right
Dont know what is wrong
Im singing my song
Im not trying to hide
That I am beautiful inside
Beautiful inside
Am I drunk or high tonight
I am sure that I dont care at all
Do you still wanna hold me tight
Now Im not sure that I dont care at all
You wont hear me lie
Because I dont care at all
Im little creep inside
I just dont care at all
If U`ll take me away
Whatever U do
Whatever U say
I dont care about me
I dont care about U
I dont know what is right
Dont know what is wrong
Im singing my song
Im not trying to hide
That I am beautiful inside
Beautiful inside.             "
