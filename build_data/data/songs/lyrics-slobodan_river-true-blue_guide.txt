                Get off your hands from there 
Gently smooth my hair
Yeah, I smell this money fragrance
You're the man, no doubt you're famous
Anything you want, just take 
You need a progress, let me handle it
Change your trousers 
I like your hips
You need a hand to rearrange details
I will act, so you wont break your nails
And I don't blame baby I don't mind
You may play or hide, start the fight
I don't blame baby I don`t mind 
I'm your true-blue guide
Don't waist our time, I have to remaind you
A teenage experience
This silk I wear is cheap for your bride
But I am only your true-blue guide
And I don't blame baby I don't mind
You may play or hide, start the fight
I don't blame baby I don't mind 
I'm your true-blue guide
And I don't blame baby I don't mind
You may play or hide, start the fight
I don't blame baby I don't mind 
I'm your  true-blue guide
Don't be shy, oh don't play fool
C'mon tell me what to do
It's allowed here youth insanity
C'mon let's  till you come in me 
And I don't blame baby I don't mind
You may play or hide, start the fight
I don't blame baby I don't mind 
I'm your  true-blue guide
And I don't blame baby I don't mind
You may play or hide, start the fight
I don't blame baby I don't mind 
I'm your  true-blue guide"
