                    - Spirit Animal                
                I whisper, you echo
Coiled up like snakes, won't let go 
Forever, each other
We'll fight the tooth and nail for 
We're star shot, we're night lit
We're wolves, our pack we won't quit 
Blood bonded while haunted
We're twin flames lighting up the sky
You are my spirit animal
You're my totem of love
You are the child of the moon 
You are the ruler of the sun
White tiger, the bravest
Turn dream scapes into conquest 
Licked crystals of tree sweat
Now I have become ancient
You're howling, I'll follow
You're liquid when I swallow
Spit thunder, joined hunger
We're twin flames lighting up the sky
You are my spirit animal
You're my totem of love
You are the child of the moon 
You are the ruler of the sun            "
