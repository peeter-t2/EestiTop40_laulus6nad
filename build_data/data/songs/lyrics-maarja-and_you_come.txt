                    - And You Come                
                When I open up a page of my past
I find it blue Â–
Love enough for two but no-one around,
Nothing to do.
I found no meaning
In the world at all
Bravehearted I started
Knocking on your wall
And you came
And you came
Showing me a whole new world
And you came
And you came
I will never be the same
And you came
Like a flame
That I hope will never die
Showing me a whole new world
And you came
And you came
And you got me outta frame
I will never be the same
When I open up a page of my past
I find it white
Now it's getting clear the colours appear
Out of your light
The freedom
I cherished
Was a fool's paradise
But when I met you
I got humanized
My shelter and my shooting star
That's what you are to me
You made my life complete
It feels so good
The past is gone
The past is done
No white, no blue 
I'll stay with you             "
