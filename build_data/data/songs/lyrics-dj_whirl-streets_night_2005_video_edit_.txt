                    - Streets @ Night 2005 (video edit)                
                All the world is passing by
I feel the weight on my feet
I'v been walking all day
Now the night surrounds me
Traffic lights and shining stars
what I see above me
Lead the way, they are my guides
helping you to find me
Streets at night            "
