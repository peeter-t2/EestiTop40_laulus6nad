                    Claire's Birthday
                    - Venus                
                you want to get married
he wants to screw
you know that he's at it
can't say the same about you
you want him to listen
but failed to get his thoughts off the cars
kind a guy
who leaves a dead poet on your cup-board
flyes back to mars
you know that
for you there'll be no tomorrow
praying for a better day
trying to spend the day away
you're 26 but you look so much older
so what will you be like tomorrow
praying for a better day
trying to spend the day away
he bought you a record
called the power of love
romance in a gutters
god he makes you want to trow up
so you pray to god
worship it throught his penis
his idea of making love
while he's having his peanuts
all men are pigs you're the venus
you name his son swineard after jesus            "
